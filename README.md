# Computer-Systems
Assignments/Labs from CSCI-2400

-----
##### This is a semester's worth of assignments completed in CU Boulder's Computer Systems class (CSCI 2400). 

##### I recieved full marks on all of these assignments- so they should be operable for full completion given that you understand the material/ are able to explain it.
-----
  ##### The Bomb Lab,however, is individual to the user and every distribution will be different per user. If you're feeling lost, I recommend taking a look at: http://zpalexander.com/binary-bomb-lab-phase-1/ 
  ##### He has a nice blog and explains the lab pretty thoroughly. You likely will not need his full explanation past Phase-1, but his introduction is a useful starter. 
-----
 ##### The Attack Lab is also on a per-user basis, so this code won't be of much use to anyone. (They have new seeds generated for each distribution which changes your individual problem.)

  ##### For the Attack Lab, if you follow the lab write-up, you should be able to get pretty far independantly.
